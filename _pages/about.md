I am a postdoctoral researcher in the field of condensed matter physics, currently in the group of [Prof. Allan MacDonald](https://web2.ph.utexas.edu/~macdgrp/) at the [Center for Complex Quantum Systems](http://order.ph.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I obtained my PhD degree at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://itp.phys.ethz.ch/) of ETH Zürich, supervised by [Prof. Gianni Blatter](https://itp.phys.ethz.ch/research/condmat/vortex.html) (*condensed and coherent quantum systems*) and [Prof. Oded Zilberberg](https://quest.phys.ethz.ch/) (*quantum engineered systems*).

My research focuses on low-energy models and exotic observable signatures *(e.g. in electronic spectra, local density of states, absorption spectra)* in singlelayer, bilayer and few-layer materials *(e.g. graphene, hBN, MoS2)* and syntheticically engineered analogues thereof. These two-dimensional materials provide a natural platform for moiré superstructures by stacking layers with small twists. Such moiré lead to rare phenomena (*e.g. fractal Landau-Hofstadter subband splitting, engineerable flat bands, ...*) associated to the emergence of a new length scale (*exceeding the microscopic lattice constants by an order of magnitude)*. I investigte effective models that capture the essential features of moiré structures to provide deeper understanding to complementary numerical studies.

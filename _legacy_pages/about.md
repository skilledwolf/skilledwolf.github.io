As a physicist with 8+ years of research experience in complex quantum matter, I drive innovative research and advancements in condensed matter theory. My collaborative efforts with top-tier scientists and institutions have led to presentations at international forums and impactful publications in peer-reviewed journals. In my academic career, I have gained software development, computing infrastructure, and project management skills. My core competencies include problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and teamwork. I am passionate about advancing the frontiers of knowledge and innovation in physics and related fields and contributing to the scientific community and society.


I am a currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) where I work with [Prof. Allan MacDonald](https://web2.ph.utexas.edu/~macdgrp/) and his group at the [Center for Complex Quantum Systems](http://order.ph.utexas.edu/). I received my PhD degree at ETH Zürich advised by [Prof. Gianni Blatter](https://itp.phys.ethz.ch/research/condmat/vortex.html) (*condensed and coherent quantum systems*) and [Prof. Oded Zilberberg](https://quest.phys.ethz.ch/) (*quantum engineered systems*) at the [Institute for Theoretical Physics](https://itp.phys.ethz.ch/). 

My research deals with emergent phenomena in condensed matter, particularly involving recent developments around two-dimensional van der Waals materials like graphene multilayers and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In my Ph.D., I investigated how twist-engineered moiré structures at stacking interfaces give rise to unusual symmetry-broken phases and valley band topology through unusual Berry curvatures and flat bands susceptible to interaction-induced spin and valley polarization. At UT Austin, motivated by experimental discoveries, I have been studying metallic magnetism and superconductivity in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, providing insights into the competition between magnetism, valley polarization, and intervalley coherence near van Hove singularities, and collective-mode excitation spectra and correlation energy in continuum models. Balancing analytical insights and numerical approaches, I study low-energy effective models, observable signatures *(e.g. in electronic spectra, local density of states, absorption spectra)* in singlelayer, bilayer and few-layer materials *(e.g. graphene, hBN, MoS2)* and their artificial analogues, and emergent moiré length-scale phenomena (*e.g. fractal Landau-Hofstadter subband splitting, engineerable flat bands, interaction-induced magnetic instabilities *).
